It is 9:00 A.M monday, Alan woke up in a hurry to attend chris' call and cursed his alarm for not waking him up. The call was very important
as it decided whether he would get a promotion or not. Alan works for a gaming company as a game developer which has a hidden
agenda unknown to Alan pr any of its employees upto a certain level. Getting the promotion would mean he would have a seat
at the table and find out the true motive of the company. As Alan picks up the call, Chris immediately tell him to get his
butt to the office right away for an important meeting. Alan replies "I'll be there in 15 minutes". As he rushes off to work,
he gets into an accident and someone kidnaps him. Alan remains unconcious until he is woken up by a person wearing a grey suit.
A person he recognizes as his boss......
Alarmed and agitated by the horrific turn of events, Angry-Alan demands explanation from his boss- Wade Watts.
Wade sighs, looks into Alan's eyes with sheer calm as he says,"Thanos is alive and we must find him soon." 
Alan stiffens, Thanos being alive was supposed to be a secret as Alan was the one who helped him escape.
In meanwhile one guy enters the room and tell "alan is the one behind Thanos escape", as Wade listens to that he just to shoot alan with a gun...
wade will point the gun at alan and suddenly he will turn the gun and shoot the person who just now said about alan. The person whom wade
shot was Chris....
